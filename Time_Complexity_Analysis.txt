## ⏱️ Time Complexity Analysis

| Operation/Structure            | Singly Linked List | Binary Search Tree (BST) | Min-Heap | Hash Map |
|--------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|----------|----------|
| **Insertion**                  | O(n)               | O(log n) (balanced)      | O(log n) | O(1)     |
| **Search**                     | O(n)               | O(log n) (balanced)      | O(n)     | O(1)     |
| **Display (Sorted)**           | O(n)               | O(n)                     | O(n log n)| O(n log n) |
| **Find Most Frequent Element** | O(n)               | O(n)                     | O(n)     | O(n)     |

### 1. **Singly Linked List**:
   - **Insertion**: O(n) – Inserting elements in a sorted order requires scanning the entire list to find the correct position.
   - **Search**: O(n) – The list needs to be traversed sequentially to find an element.
   - **Display (Sorted)**: O(n) – Traversing the entire list to display it.
   - **Find Most Frequent Element**: O(n) – Every element must be checked to find the maximum frequency.

### 2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
   - **Insertion**: O(log n) – In a balanced BST, insertion is logarithmic as it requires finding the correct position in a tree of height log(n).
   - **Search**: O(log n) – Searching is logarithmic for a balanced BST.
   - **Display (Sorted)**: O(n) – An in-order traversal is used to display the elements in sorted order.
   - **Find Most Frequent Element**: O(n) – Every node must be checked to find the maximum frequency.

> **Note**: The time complexities assume a balanced BST (like AVL or Red-Black Tree). For an unbalanced BST, the worst-case time complexities can degrade to O(n).

### 3. **Min-Heap**:
   - **Insertion**: O(log n) – Each insertion involves a sift-up operation to maintain the heap property.
   - **Search**: O(n) – Searching for a specific element in a heap is not efficient as the structure is optimized for finding the minimum element, not arbitrary searches.
   - **Display (Sorted)**: O(n log n) – Sorting the heap to display the elements requires re-sorting (heapsort).
   - **Find Most Frequent Element**: O(n) – The heap does not provide direct access to the most frequent element, requiring a linear scan of all elements.

### 4. **Hash Map**:
   - **Insertion**: O(1) – Inserting into a hash map is nearly constant time on average due to direct indexing.
   - **Search**: O(1) – Hash maps offer average constant-time search due to direct indexing.
   - **Display (Sorted)**: O(n log n) – Elements need to be sorted before display, as hash maps do not maintain order.
   - **Find Most Frequent Element**: O(n) – The hash map must be scanned to determine the element with the highest frequency.
